This course is a shortened version of our full course and covers downstream analysis of ChIP-seq following peak calling and aquisition of QC results.\r\n\r\nThe course consists of 7 sections.\r\n* Evaluation of ChIP-seq specific QC metrics\r\n* Working with peaks.\r\n* Functional annotation of peaks.\r\n* Motif identification.\r\n* External/Public datasets.\r\n* Exporting data.\r\n* Complex overlaps.\r\n* Simple differential ChIP-seq.\r\n\r\nEach section is presented as both HTMl and Rpres markdown ( to allow for intergration of the presentation in the RStudio enviroment itself).  Exercises and answer sheets are included after all subsections to practice techniques and provide future reference examples. \r\n\r\nCourse material and exercises are available to view as rendered HTML slides or single page HTML at [http://mrccsc.github.io/ChIPseq_short/](http://mrccsc.github.io/ChIPseq_short).  \r\nAll material is available to download under GPL v3 license.\r\n\r\nFor  information on other courses run by our team see our [github IO page](http://mrccsc.github.io/training/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Team\r\nThis course was created and conducted by the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre Bioinformatics Team at Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital.  \r\nFor more information on the team see our [github IO page](http://mrccsc.github.io/).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis course is free for MRC CSC and Imperial staff and students.
